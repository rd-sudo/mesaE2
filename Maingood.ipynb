    "This project implements a traffic simulation model using the Mesa framework. The simulation aims to model the movement of cars within a city grid, incorporating traffic lights and parking spots. The primary goal is to simulate realistic traffic behavior, including car movements, traffic light interactions, and parking dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation is built on a 24x24 grid, where each cell can represent different elements such as roads, buildings, parking spots, and traffic lights. Car agents navigate through the grid based on predefined directional coordinates and traffic light states, aiming to reach their target parking spots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of the project include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Car Agents: Simulated cars that move around the grid, following traffic rules and aiming to park in available spots.\n",
    "- Traffic Light Agents: Traffic lights that control the flow of car agents at intersections, switching between red and green states.\n",
    "- Grid Representation: A multi-layer grid that includes buildings, roads, and parking spots.\n",
    "- Visualization: Tools for visualizing the simulation, including the positions of car agents and the states of traffic lights.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project leverages the Mesa framework for agent-based modeling and includes various components for data collection and visualization to analyze the simulation results."
